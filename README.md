# IPL Analysis Project using Power BI

Welcome to my IPL Analysis project! In this project, I analyze Indian Premier League (IPL) data to uncover key trends and patterns. I use Power BI for data transformation, cleaning, and visualization, providing interactive dashboards and insights to support strategic business decisions.

## Project Overview

I collected, cleaned, and analyzed IPL match data from various sources to identify important trends and patterns. I developed visualizations and interactive dashboards using Power BI to effectively communicate insights to stakeholders. Additionally, I performed statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to validate my findings and enhance data-driven decision-making.

## Key Achievements

- **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Collected IPL match data from Kaggle and other sources. Cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query Editor in Power BI.
- **Data Analysis:** Conducted statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to validate insights and support better decision-making.
- **Visualizations & Dashboards:** Created interactive dashboards and visualizations using Power BI to clearly communicate key trends and insights.
- **Data Quality Improvement:** Identified opportunities to improve data quality and suggested automated solutions for data transformation.
- **Presentation:** Presented data insights to both technical and non-technical audiences to support strategic decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI:** For data transformation, cleaning, and visualization.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For advanced calculations and KPIs.
- **Power Query Editor:** For data transformation and cleaning.

## Getting Started

To explore the IPL Analysis project in Power BI, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Power BI Desktop (latest version)
- IPL dataset (available on Kaggle)

### Installation

#### 1. Download the Dataset
Obtain the IPL dataset from Kaggle.

#### 2. Install Power BI Desktop
If you don’t have Power BI Desktop, download and install it from the official Power BI website.

#### 3. Load the Data
Open Power BI Desktop and load the dataset:
- Go to **Home > Get Data > CSV** (or the appropriate format).
- Select the downloaded dataset file and click **Load**.

#### 4. Transform and Clean the Data
Use Power Query Editor:
- Go to **Home > Transform Data**.
- Perform necessary transformations and clean the data as needed.

#### 5. Create KPIs and Dashboards
- Use **DAX** to define custom measures: **Modeling > New Measure**.
- Build visualizations and organize them into interactive dashboards.

## Publishing the Report

- Go to **Home > Publish** in Power BI Desktop.
- Follow the steps to publish the report to Power BI Service (Online).

## Project Structure

- `IPL_Analysis.pbix`: Power BI project file with visualizations and data models.
- `Data/`: Folder containing the IPL dataset and supporting files.

## Usage

Open the `IPL_Analysis.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop to view dashboards and insights. Use the interactive features to explore various aspects of IPL data.
